This is a Remix + TypeScript project with Tailwind CSS pre-configured and ready to use.

STYLING:
- Tailwind CSS is already installed and configured — utility classes work immediately
- Use Tailwind utility classes for ALL styling (e.g., className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow")
- Do NOT create CSS modules — always use Tailwind classes inline in JSX
- Follow mobile-first responsive design: sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints
- Tailwind CSS is imported in app/root.tsx

COMMANDS — you have full shell access and MUST use it:
- Run `npm install && npm run dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
- NEVER use `remix dev` directly — always use `npm run dev`
- You CAN and SHOULD run any shell commands needed (npm install, npm run dev, etc.)
