CRITICAL Remix WebContainer Rules:
- package.json MUST have "type": "module"
- vite.config.ts uses ESM imports with @remix-run/dev vitePlugin
- ALWAYS use `npm run dev` to start — never use bare `remix dev` or `vite`
- Routes go in app/routes/ directory (file-based routing)
- Root layout is app/root.tsx
- Use loader/action pattern for data fetching
